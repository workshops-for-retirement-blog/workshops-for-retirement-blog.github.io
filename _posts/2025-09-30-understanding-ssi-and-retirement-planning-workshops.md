Thinking about retirement can bring up lots of questions, especially when it comes to Social Security benefits and supplemental income. For many retirees and soon-to-be retirees, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a key part of their financial picture. Understanding how SSI fits into your retirement planning is essential, and one of the best ways to get reliable, in-person information is by attending **retirement workshops** in your area.

## What Is SSI and Why Does It Matter?

SSI, or Supplemental Security Income, is a federal program that provides monthly payments to people with limited income and resources who are age 65 or older, or who are blind or disabled. Unlike regular Social Security benefits, SSI isn’t based on your work history—it’s a safety net for those who need extra help. Many people don’t realize they might qualify for SSI, or how it can be combined with other retirement income sources.

Knowing the differences between SSI and Social Security, and how to maximize these benefits, can have a significant impact on your financial security in retirement.
