Planning for retirement can sometimes feel like playing the mass lottery—you hope for the best, but the odds can feel uncertain. The good news is, you don’t have to leave your future to chance. At Workshops For Retirement, we believe that real success in retirement planning comes from practical knowledge, smart strategies, and expert guidance—not luck.

## Why Retirement Planning Feels Like a Lottery

Many retirees and pre-retirees wonder:  
- **When should I take Social Security benefits?**  
- **Should I roll over my 401(k)?**  
- **What’s the best way to retire with $500k?**

Without the right information, making these decisions can feel like picking numbers and hoping for a win. But with the right support, you can stack the odds in your favor.
