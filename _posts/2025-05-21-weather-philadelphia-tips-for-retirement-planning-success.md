Retirement planning is a journey shaped by many factors—from your financial goals to the changing seasons of life. Just as you might check the weather in Philadelphia before heading out for the day, it’s wise to prepare for the financial climate that awaits you in retirement. If you're a pre-retiree in North America, particularly if you have $250,000 or more in investable assets, understanding how to build a resilient retirement plan is essential.

## Why Retirement Planning Workshops Matter

When you’re nearing retirement, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by questions about Social Security, Medicare, 401(k) rollover advice, and tax-efficient retirement strategies. That’s why attending local retirement planning workshops can make all the difference. Workshops For Retirement offers free, in-person and online retirement planning workshops designed to address your specific needs, whether you’re in Philadelphia or another part of the country.

Our retirement planning workshops are led by experienced financial professionals who understand the unique challenges facing today’s retirees. You’ll gain insights into topics such as:

- **Retirement income planning:** Learn how to turn your savings into a steady, sustainable income stream.
- **Social Security strategy:** Discover how to maximize your benefits and time your claims for the greatest long-term impact.
- **Medicare planning:** Navigate enrollment, supplemental coverage, and out-of-pocket costs.
- **Tax-efficient retirement strategies:** Find out how smart planning can help reduce your tax burden in retirement.
