Ever found yourself asking, "Is the stock market open today?" For many retirees and pre-retirees, the answer can impact more than just daily headlines—it can influence your retirement planning, investment strategies, and even decisions about when to take Social Security benefits.

## Why Market Hours Matter for Retirement Planning

Understanding when the stock market is open is more than trivia. If you’re considering moves like rolling over your 401(k), adjusting investments, or seeking advice from a [California Financial Advisor](https://workshopsforretirement.com/), knowing trading days is crucial. For instance:

- **401(k) rollovers** often process based on market hours, affecting timing and potential value.
- **Buying or selling investments** happens only when the market is active.
- **Social Security timing** may be influenced by market trends and personal investment performance.

Relying solely on online calendars can be tricky, especially with observed holidays and early closures. If you’re seeking the best way to retire with $500k or more, staying informed could make a difference.

## Common Questions from Retirees

### Is the Stock Market Open on Federal Holidays?

No, U.S. markets close for major holidays like New Year’s Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. There are also shortened hours on days like Black Friday and Christmas Eve.

### Does It Affect My Retirement Income?

It can. If you regularly withdraw from investment accounts or want to maximize Social Security, understanding market schedules helps you plan distributions and consult with your [Texas Financial Planner](https://workshopsforretirement.com/) or advisor at the right time.
