Retirement planning can feel overwhelming, especially when life’s big changes—like divorce—affect your financial future. Whether you’re approaching retirement or already enjoying your golden years, understanding how events like divorce impact your Social Security, taxes, and investments is crucial. That’s where Workshops For Retirement steps in, offering free, in-person retirement workshops designed to give you the confidence and clarity you need.

### Why Divorce Changes Your Retirement Roadmap

A divorce can reshape your entire financial landscape. From splitting retirement accounts to updating estate plans, the choices you make now can affect the retirement lifestyle you’ve worked hard to build. Many re-retirees and retirees wonder:

- Should I roll over my 401(k)?
- What’s the best way to retire with $500k?
- How do divorce settlements affect Social Security benefits?
- When should I take Social Security benefits post-divorce?
- What tax strategies for retirees can help keep more money in my pocket?

These are questions that a divorce lawyer and a [State] Financial Advisor or [State] Financial Planner can help you answer. But what if you could get practical retirement planning guidance for free?
