As we approach the golden years, the concept of retirement can feel both exciting and daunting. Many of us dream of traveling the world, spending more time with loved ones, or simply enjoying a slower pace of life. However, achieving these dreams requires careful planning, particularly for those with substantial investable assets.

### Why Retirement Planning Matters

For those who have won big in the "NC Lottery" or simply accumulated significant savings over the years, making informed financial decisions is crucial. Without a solid plan, even a large sum can dwindle faster than expected. This is why retirement planning should be on your radar, especially if you have $250,000 or more in investable assets.
