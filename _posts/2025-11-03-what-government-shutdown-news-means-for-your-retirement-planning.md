When headlines feature government shutdown news, it’s natural to wonder how it might affect your retirement planning. Questions pop up: Will Social Security payments be delayed? Are Medicare benefits safe? Is now the right time to revisit your investment mix or tax strategies? For retirees or pre-retirees, these uncertainties can make financial planning feel overwhelming.

But here’s the good news: You don’t have to navigate these concerns alone. Free retirement workshops and seminars are available across the USA, offering clarity on pressing topics like Social Security, tax strategies for retirees, and investment advice for seniors. Whether you’re just starting to plan or refining your approach, these sessions offer practical, up-to-date guidance.
