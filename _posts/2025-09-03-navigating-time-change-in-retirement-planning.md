Twice a year, we adjust our clocks for the time change—just another reminder of how life’s rhythms keep shifting. For those nearing retirement or already enjoying their golden years, these changes are a great opportunity to pause and review your retirement planning. As seasons shift and time moves forward, so does the importance of staying prepared for what’s ahead.

## Why Time Change Is the Perfect Moment to Review Your Retirement Plans

Just like the clock, your financial goals and needs may need fine-tuning. Retirement planning is not a one-and-done task; it’s an ongoing journey that benefits from regular check-ins. The time change can serve as a reminder to ask yourself:

- Are you on track to maximize Social Security benefits?
- Have you updated your investment strategies to match your current priorities?
- Are you confident about your tax strategies for retirees?
- Is your estate planning up to date?

If these questions spark uncertainty, you’re not alone. Many retirees and pre-retirees across the USA are unsure about the best way to retire with $500k or when to take Social Security benefits. That’s where our in-person **Retirement Workshops** come in.
