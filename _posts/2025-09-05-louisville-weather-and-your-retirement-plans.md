As any Louisville local knows, the weather here can keep you guessing—sunny mornings, sudden rain showers, and the kind of seasonal shifts that remind us how important it is to plan ahead. For pre-retirees and retirees, being prepared doesn’t just mean packing an umbrella; it means setting up your finances for a future as comfortable as a mild Kentucky spring.

Retirement planning is about more than picking the right date to stop working. It’s about understanding how factors like Social Security, tax strategies, and investment options can help you weather any financial storm. That’s where Retirement Workshops come in—a no-cost, in-person opportunity to get informed, ask questions, and connect with knowledgeable financial advisors.
