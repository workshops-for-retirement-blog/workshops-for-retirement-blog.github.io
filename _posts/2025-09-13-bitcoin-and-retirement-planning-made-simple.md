Thinking about retirement planning can feel overwhelming—especially with modern trends like bitcoin making headlines.

At Workshops For Retirement, we understand the unique questions facing today’s retirees and pre-retirees. Our free, in-person retirement workshops are designed to answer your biggest questions and help you retire with confidence.

## Should Bitcoin Be Part Of Your Retirement Plan?

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are generating a lot of buzz. Some investors see them as a new frontier, while others approach with caution. If you’re nearing or already in retirement, your main goal is usually to protect and grow your nest egg, not chase risky trends. But with so much information (and misinformation) out there, how do you make smart decisions?

- **Insightful discussions** on current investment options, including the pros and cons of digital assets
- **Guidance from experienced financial advisors** who understand the needs of retirees
- **Clear explanations** on topics like “Should I roll over my 401(k)?” and “What’s the best way to retire with $500k?”
- **Updates on Social Security, Medicare, and tax strategies for retirees**
