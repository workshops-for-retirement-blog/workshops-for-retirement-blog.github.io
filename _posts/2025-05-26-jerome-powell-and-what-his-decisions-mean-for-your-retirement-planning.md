When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks, the financial world listens. But what do his decisions and comments mean for you as a current or future retiree? Understanding how the Federal Reserve’s policies affect retirement planning can help you make smarter choices about Social Security, taxes, investments, and more. That’s where Retirement Workshops come in—designed to break down these complex topics into practical, actionable strategies tailored for your retirement goals.

## Why Jerome Powell’s Policies Matter to Retirees

Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve set interest rates and influence the economic environment. These decisions impact:

- **Your Investments**: Interest rate changes can affect bond yields, stock market performance, and even the value of your 401(k) or IRA.
- **Social Security Timing**: Economic forecasts can help you decide when to take Social Security benefits for maximum advantage.
- **Tax Strategies**: Inflation and interest rates play a role in tax planning, especially for retirees drawing from multiple sources.

Understanding these connections can be overwhelming. That’s why Retirement Workshops are so valuable—they break down what’s happening in Washington into steps you can use to protect and grow your retirement savings.
