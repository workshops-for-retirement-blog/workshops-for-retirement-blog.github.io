As you approach retirement, the landscape of financial planning becomes increasingly critical. One significant aspect that often gets overlooked is the impact of current mortgage rates on your overall retirement strategy. With the economy ever-evolving, understanding how these rates affect your financial health is crucial, especially for those with substantial investable assets.

### Why Current Mortgage Rates Matter

Current mortgage rates can significantly influence your financial planning, particularly if you're nearing retirement. A lower mortgage rate may reduce monthly payments, freeing up funds for other investments. Conversely, higher rates could strain your budget, making strategic financial planning essential. 

As someone with $500,000+ in investable assets, leveraging these rates to optimize your retirement plan is vital. With the right guidance, you can ensure that your mortgage doesn’t become a burden in your golden years.
