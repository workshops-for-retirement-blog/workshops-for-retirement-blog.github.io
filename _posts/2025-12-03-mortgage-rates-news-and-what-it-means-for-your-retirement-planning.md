If you’re planning for retirement or already enjoying your golden years, you’ve probably noticed the headlines about mortgage rates. With rates fluctuating, many retirees are left wondering how these changes could impact their financial future, especially when it comes to retirement planning. Whether you’re considering a move, looking to downsize, or simply want to understand how your home factors into your overall retirement strategy, staying informed is key.

## Why Mortgage Rates Matter for Retirement

Mortgage rates have a direct impact on your monthly expenses, your ability to tap into home equity, and your overall net worth. Here’s how recent mortgage rates news might affect your retirement:
