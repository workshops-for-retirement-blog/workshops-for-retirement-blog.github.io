Taking care of your mental health is just as important as planning for your financial future—especially in retirement. As more retirees and pre-retirees embrace the benefits of a “mental health day,” it’s the perfect opportunity to reflect on how your emotional well-being is connected to your peace of mind about retirement planning.  

Whether you’ve already retired or are looking forward to the next stage, making space for yourself—mentally and financially—can help you enjoy your golden years to the fullest. Let’s explore how a mental health day can inspire smarter choices around retirement workshops, retirement seminars, and more.

## Why Mental Health Days Matter for Retirees

Retirement is a major transition, and it’s normal to feel a mix of excitement and uncertainty. Taking a mental health day means pausing to recharge and check in on your well-being. It’s also a great time to assess your readiness for retirement—not just emotionally, but financially.
