When news of a potential Democrats government shutdown makes headlines, it’s natural to wonder how such events might affect your retirement plans. For retirees and pre-retirees across the USA, government actions can impact everything from Social Security to Medicare, tax strategies, and investment options. That’s why staying informed and proactive in your retirement planning is more important than ever.

## Why Government Shutdowns Matter for Retirees
