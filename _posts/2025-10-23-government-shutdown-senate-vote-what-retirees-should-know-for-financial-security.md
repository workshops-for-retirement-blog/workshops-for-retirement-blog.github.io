A recent government shutdown senate vote has many retirees and pre-retirees feeling uncertain about their retirement planning. When Congress debates federal funding, questions about Social Security payments, Medicare, and economic stability often come up. If you’re planning your retirement or already enjoying your golden years, understanding how these decisions might affect your finances is crucial.
