## Introduction

This Cookie Policy explains how {{ site.title }} ("we", "us", and "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at {{ site.url }} ("Website"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, {{ site.title }}) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

## Why do we use cookies?

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Website. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for analytics and other purposes.

## Types of cookies we use

The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our Website and the purposes they perform are described below:

### Essential Cookies

These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Website, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our Website functions.

### Performance and Functionality Cookies

These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.

### Analytics and Customization Cookies

These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Website for you. We use Google Analytics for this purpose.

## How can you control cookies?

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences through our cookie consent banner that appears when you visit our Website.

You can also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Website though your access to some functionality and areas of our Website may be restricted.

## How often will we update this Cookie Policy?

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.

The date at the bottom of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.
